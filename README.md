# Video Coding Tutorial (VCT)
Tutorials on the fundamentals tools used in image and video compression.

## Introduction
The Video Coding Tutorial (VCT) repository provides a set of Jupyter notebooks to explain the fundations of image and data compression with focus on the following aspects:
 * [Entropy coding](./entropy-coding)
 * [Transform coding](./transform-coding)
 * [Quantisation](./quantisation)

The material has been prepared with the aim to complement the theoretical fundations that can be learned from some of the classical text books on image and video compression (see below for a list of references). It is believed that seeing how the theory is put into limited, yet practical examples, readers will strengthen their understanding in the area of compresison for visual data.

## References
Some good textbooks that can be used to learn the fundamentals as well as being up to date with the state-of-the-art are:
