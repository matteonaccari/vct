More precisely, we might end up in a situation where `low_k = 0x7FFFFFFF` and `high_k = 0x80000000`.

    "## Conclusive remarks\n",
    "We now got in place an entropy coding engine which performs arithmetic coding (a.k.a. Elias coding) using integer arithmetic. Moreover, we've also shown a practical way to build a multiplier free variant, which is the one described in Annex D of JPEG standard [ITU-T T.81](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-T.81) (collectively known as the **JPEG standard**). If our aim were to just describe the implementation of a practical arithmetic coding engine, we would be done now. However, the achievement of the Shannon's entropy by an arithmetic encoder can only be guaranteed if we are able to model correctly the probability of our binary source (or in general our source's *PMF*). Accordingly, here it comes the engineering bit of the arithmetic encoding process which, not surprisingly, can be regarded as a sort of *art and craft*. We'll delve into this subject in the following Jupyter notebook belonging to this tutorial on arithmetic coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another remark is on the integer precision implementation of arithmetic coding with multiplication. This essentially resembles to the well-known [range encoder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_encoding) investigated by N. Martin in 1979. Such a range encoder has then been simplified by the so-called Asymmetric Numerical System (ANS)  entropy coding, which is a clever way of looking at arithmetic coding from a different perspective. A flavour of ANS is currently under consideration in JPEG for the activities related to the **[JPEG-XL](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceedings/Download?fullDOI=10.1117%2F12.2529237)** standard."
