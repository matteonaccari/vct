# Arithmetic coding: Fundamentals, practical scheme and applications
This tutorial will introduce you to an important entropy coding scheme: *arithmetic coding*. Its importance resides in the fact that it can achieve the Shannon's entropy bound by performing coding with a fractional number of bits (which is not possible with schemes such as Huffman coding). Thanks to this properties, arithmetic coding has found its way into several image and video coding standards such as JPEG, JPEG 2000, H.264/AVC, H.265/HEVC and the current state-of-the-art H.266/VVC. The tutorial is divided into three main parts, each associated with a sub-directory as follows:
 * [**Introduction**](./introduction/arithmetic-coding-intro.ipynb): Where a recall on the fundamentals of variable length coding and the main results of the Shannon's information theory.
 * [**Practical schemes**](./practical-schemes/practical-ac-schemes.ipynb): Where the initial formulation of arithmetic coding (Elias coding) is extended to implement the coding engine with arithmetic precision
 * [**Application to JPEG**](./ac-in-jpeg/jpeg-like-coeff-coding.ipynb): Where a particular implementation of a multiplier free arithmetic coding engine, the *QM encoder*, is applied to coding of transform coefficients in an image codec ala JPEG.
